# Kanji Kentei: How I practiced for and passed the test

In the June of 2022, I took the [Japan Kanji Aptitude Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji_Kentei), commonly known as the Kanji Kentei. Here are some of my thoughts why I decided to take it, as well as an outline of study methods I used to ultimately achieve a passing grade.

## Background 
I moved to Japan in October 2021 to work as a CIR in the JET Programme. My Japanese was decent already, and by that point, it was almost three years ago when I had passed the JLPT N1, the highest level in the Japanese Language Proficiency Test, perhaps the most prominent standardized test for Japanese learners. However, despite being able to speak, read and understand spoken Japanese, I quickly discovered a deficiency in my abilities: writing by hand. I had practiced writing Japanese by hand in 2014 when using [the Heisig method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi) briefly, but other than that, I had not really put any significant time into learning how to *actually* write Japanese. 

Despite the smartphone and the computer being as ubiquitous in Japan as in any other developed nation, handwriting is still a skill that I've personally found to be somewhat important for conducting independent life in Japan. The town hall, banks, receptions in various facilities such as restaurants and hotels among other places sometimes ask you to write your personal information on paper by hand, especially during the age of the global pandemic, when that information is used to track down close contacts. Being asked to write your own address in *kanji*, the set of Chinese characters used in the Japanese language, is something that most people here face on a regular basis. 

Being able to take notes in Japanese is another skill that practically requires the ability to write at least some kanji. Yes, Japanese *can* be written using purely just *kana* syllabary. However, reading long passages of such text is rather annoying, as Japanese is usually written using both kana and kanji. Taking notes by hand to be later read by your coworkers and friends, writing postcards and letters, arguably even reading other people's handwriting all require at least a little ability to write some kanji. 

Now what would be a good goal to work towards with regards to kanji writing ability? Since this is Japan, of course there is a standardized test for that.   

## Introduction to the Kanji Kentei
The Kanji Kentei has 12 levels, any of which can be attempted by simply filing an application and paying a fee, there are no additional requirements for taking the test. Levels from 10 to 4 cover kanji studied in elementary school according to the standard, nationwide Japanese curriculum. Level 3 covers kanji studied by the end of junior high school, while levels pre-2, 2, pre-1 and 1 cover kanji used in high school, academia and beyond. 

I chose to sign up for the level 3 test, since most kanji covered in that level are fairly commonly used. Levels from pre-2 onwards would have covered more kanji, but since the law of diminishing returns applies to studying kanji as well, meaning that the additional kanji in those higher levels would be used more rarely, I decided that level 3 would be a reasonable goal.

The test itself consists 10 sections: 
* Reading (writing the correct phonetic readings for kanji words)
* Homophone distinction (choosing kanji for words with the same phonetic reading)
* Kanji recognition (filling in missing kanji for compound words) 
* Compound word classification (choosing the right class for compound words)
* Radicals (recognizing the visual component under which the kanji is classified)
* Antonyms and synonyms
* Kanji and okurigana (choosing the right okurigana for words)
* Four-character compounds (by far the most challenging part of the test!)
* Correcting misspelled kanji
* Writing (replacing a kana word with the relevant kanji)

At a first glance, the list of sections in the test might look exhausting. However, knowing Japanese helps, and if your Japanese level is already JLPT N1-passing or higher, chances are that you would only really need to learn to write some characters in order to pass the test. On top of that, the first five sections of the test do not require writing any kanji: questions are answered by either writing hiragana or choosing a multiple-choice answer. Only sections from 6 to 10 consist of questions where you actually need to write kanji with the correct stroke order on the exam sheet. 

Here's the level 3 test in numbers:
* 1623 kanji covered 
* 120 questions, each worth one or two points
* 200 points maximum
* 140 points to pass
* 60 minutes of answering time
* 3500 yen test fee

The test can be taken in the standard paper format while there is a computerized version (Kanken CBT) available as well. I chose the standard paper format, as I do not have a tablet that I could practice writing on. However, the computerized version of the test has a couple of advantages over the regular one, such as quicker delivery of test results and better availability of test days, so both options are worth considering, if you're confident in writing on a digitizer screen. 

Funnily enough, while almost no Japanese recognize the JLPT (*Nihongo Nōryoku Shiken* in Japanese) or know what it is, almost everybody seems to what the Kanken is. 

## Study Methods

I did most studying for the test using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), which is an excellent memorization application making use of a technique called [spaced repetition.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) I have used Anki since at least 2014, and it has helped me immensely on my journey towards fluency in Japanese, so choosing it to study for the test was a natural choice for me. 

The Anki deck (= set of flashcards) I chose to download & import to the program was QM's [Complete Jouyou Kanji Writing Deck.](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/759825185) Kanji in this deck is grouped by Kanken level, so tracking progress towards completing all level 3 kanji is extremely easy. Basically, the deck shows you a sentence with one underlined word written in hiragana, and the goal is to write that word in kanji correctly. A simple idea, but works extremely well, especially since all sentences have audio and all kanji have stroke order information. In general, a huge part of my success in the test is owed to this excellent deck.

Statistics from Anki. Screenshot captured on June 19, on the day of the test. 

As seen in the statistics, I spent 144 hours over roughly seven months to study for the test, spending a little bit less than an hour on average. Anki works the best when you use it every day, but on some days I was traveling all day or just otherwise busy, not being able to sit down with pen and paper. 

In addition to those 144 hours spent using Anki, I also devoted some time, maybe 10 hours in total, working on two practice books specifically made for passing the level 3 test. Those books were 配当漢字を総学習! でる順 漢検3級マスター (*Haitō Kanji wo Sōgakushū! Deru Jun Kanken 3 Masutā*) by Hashimoto Kanken Series and 漢字検定 ピタリ! 予想模試 3級:漢検 受かる予想問題で対策を! (*Kanji Kentei Pitari! Yosō Moshi 3-kyū: Kanken Ukaru Yosō Mondai de Taisaku wo!*) by Kanken Kenkyūsha. The former book introduces the most commonly appeared kanji in the test, and I found especially useful when memorizing radicals. The second book is simply a collection of 15 mock exams, which I also found useful: I completed six or seven mock exams from the book before taking the exam, but I ultimately found that the real test was slightly easier than the mock exams in my case.

## The Test Day and Results
I signed up for the test on the 21st of April, and the test commenced on the 19th of June. The test voucher arrived in mail about five days before the test, which informed me about the location and time of the test. When applying for the test, I chose Miyoshi City in Hiroshima Prefecture as the test location, and the test site that I was assigned to was in Kisa, Miyoshi, about a 80-minute drive from my residence. 

Test levels 7, 5, 3 and 1 were conducted in the same room at the same time, around 1:30 pm. I noticed that other test takers were mostly elementary and junior high school students by the looks of it, while there were a few elderly people as well. I was left with the feeling that I got lucky with the test content, as I felt there were lots of words that were exactly the same as in the practice material I had chosen. 

After arriving home, I checked my answers as we got to take the question sheets home, and I self-evaluated myself at +170 points. That felt *good*. Surely I would soon get an official announcement about passing?

And that's what happened, about three weeks after the test. My total score was 155, which was lower than I expected, but still a pass by a fair margin. 

## Conclusion

Timeline:

* Baseline proficiency: JLPT N1+, weak handwriting
* November 2021 – starting to practice for the test
* April 2022 – signing up for the test 
* June 2022 – test day
* Early July 2022 – results announced
* Late July 2022 – certificate delivered by mail

In conclusion, I can say that going through the process of studying for Kanken and taking the test got me achieve my underlying goal: learning to write Japanese by hand. Since I started practicing, I could notice my writing get faster, cleaner and more confident. Even the level 3 test covers so many kanji that when writing my thoughts in Japanese on a piece of paper or a notebook, I no longer have to glance at my phone for stroke order instructions.

Whether you find all this worthwhile will greatly depend on your personal preferences and circumstances. However, I personally found making progress satisfying and the achievement meaningful.
