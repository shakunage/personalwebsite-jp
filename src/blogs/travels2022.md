# 2022: A Year in Travels

As the year 2022 inevitably concludes, it will become my first full year spent completely in Japan. Of course, during the year, I did travel to various places within the country, so here are some thoughts. Rather than making a chronological list of places I traveled to, here are some general observations and impressions from my travels in Japan.

## On the road

Life in rural Japan means that driving is the most convenient way to get around. Most of my travels were done on four wheels, apart from trips to some metropolitan areas, for which I had to opt for using a combination of car, bus and the bullet train. However, I ended up clocking more than 12,000 kilometers to the odometer of my car this year, a good chunk which of were accumulated on my travels in Japan. 

### Winter Wackiness

On snowy days, driving through the mountain range is not for the faint hearted. Snow gets piled up quickly and sliding around is almost inevitable. On the expressways, four-lane sections turn into two-lane roads. Being directed to the parking area for a tire check is also a common occurrence as the use of winter tires becomes mandatory.

### Stationing Roadside

[Roadside stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadside_station) (*Michi-no-eki*) are an essential for car travelers in Japan. Rather than fuel and fast food, these rest stops along roads serve mostly local produce and items, and many have a restaurant or a cafe attached to them, sometimes both. 

On the other hand, expressway parking areas and service areas (abbreviations PA and SA are commonly used) serve more utilitarian needs than roadside stations. A simple PA, like the Kamo-Iwakura PA along the Matsue expressway has just a couple of vending machines alongside toilet facilities. However, in a major SA, like the one in Fukuyama along the San'yō expressway, you will be able to satisfy your fast food cravings and fill up the tank.

### Tollgate Tussle

Traveling especially longer distances by car is in many cases excruciating, unless you get to drive on the expressway. However, there's a catch: driving on the expressways costs money, in most cases. Fortunately, there are some ways you can mitigate this issue.

First of all, an ETC (Electronic Toll Collection) card is a must. If you're from America, think of E-ZPass. You don't have to stop at the gate to get the ticket, and it will save you save you 30% on the toll fees on weekends and national holidays, except during New Years, Obon and Golden Week. Your car needs to have the device to slot in the card. 50% of cars in Japan have it, so make sure to stay on the ride side of that 50%. 

The ETC card itself is typically a supplementary card to a credit card. I wasn't able to get a credit card during my first six months in Japan, so I opted for [ETC Pasoca](https://www.etc-pasoca.jp/). The card has an annual fee, requires a deposit and the application requires a copy of your *residence card*. Not recommended, but it's better than no ETC card. I terminated my Pasoca as soon as I was approved for my first Japanese credit card. 

Even with the discounts, toll fares in Japan are expensive. Sources claim that tolls in Japan are three times more expensive than in France. Thus, another shrewd tip for expressway driving would be to *drive slow*. Driving slow means that you will spend more time on the road, and the fare won't feel that expensive. On top of that, your fuel economy will improve. Slowing down on the expressway really nets you a windfall of savings!

## Serendipitous Encounters

One of the best things about traveling around is encountering people form all walks of life. Having met and conversed with all kinds people, from US Marines at a bar in central Hiroshima, to octogenarian shopkeepers in rural Gifu, really makes you realize that everybody has their own story to tell with its unexpected twists. 

Maybe the luckiest encounter I had on my travels was the encounter with a fellow Finn at a [bathhouse in Kōbe](https://goo.gl/maps/5NrxhKF5R14vDx5X9). The chances of meeting a Finnish person in Japan, especially during the Covid travel curbs, are extremely low, as there are less than 800 Finns residing in Japan. Ended up having a good chat with my new friend Totti and wishing him well on his hitch hiking journey across Japan and MEXT studies in Tokyo. 

In general, I found that in Japan, the second best place best to meet new people after the restaurant is the bathhouse. On one occasion, I found myself talking to a fellow public servant employed by Chūō city, while another time we had a conversion with an elderly man on the challenges of intercultural communication, as his French son-in-law was apparently intimidated by the Japanese bathhouse experience. Striking up conversations with strangers seems to be easier when everything superficial is left in the locker room.

## Dining out

No Japan travel blog post is completely without a section about food. Generally, finding great food in Japan is no difficult task, so listing every single good restaurant experience I had would make this blog agonizingly long to the reader. Here are just some highlights that I happen to remember well enough to write about, alongside with some general thoughts about dining out. 

### Making a Reservation

If you're on a trip and dining in a major city on a Friday or Saturday night, making a reservation is a good idea, unless you want to spend some time asking places if they have seats available. I found using [Tabelog](https://tabelog.com/) extremely convenient, would have likely missed on numerous great dinners without it. A funny experience: walked into a restaurant in which I'd made a reservation. Staff tells me in English that the place is full, however when I inform him about the reservation in Japanese, it's a like a switch gets flipped inside him and he instantly guides us to our table. 

### Random Highlights

The best hamburger patties I've had in Japan, were enjoyed out of all places in a [Yamaguchi City restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/i1xidvTapiK5781L9). In Hikiniku no Tamaya, you will get three consecutive charcoal-grilled burger patties after you've finishing each one. The patties are nice and red inside while the spices give it a good kick. 

[Ogawa Coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/2w21qqFSXzR4ab9x9), a Kyoto-based coffee shop was so good that I had to visit it twice during my 3-night stay in Kyoto. Sublime atmosphere, outstanding coffee, good breakfast menu, everything you would want from a coffee shop. There are multiple shops in Kyoto, while Tokyo, Saitama, Shiga and Boston have locations too. 

### Fried to Your Liking

Before coming to Japan, Okonomiyaki was one of my favorite dishes, and it still is, after visiting half a dozen different Okonomiyaki restaurants in 2022. For the record, real Okonomiyaki can be found in and around Hiroshima, where you choose either *soba* or *udon* noodles as a topping. [Sanpachi Matsuura](https://goo.gl/maps/Rb4Bu25ezHYUvans7) would be and example of a location that represents good quality at a decent price, and consequently, I've become a regular of theirs. 

### *Kaiseki* Dreams

A year of traveling in Japan wouldn't be complete without to visit a traditional *ryokan*, where a multi-course meal of traditional Japanese dishes is served. Definitely a great experience, and a must for someone who is looking for something fancy and traditional Japanese. Personally, I think I still need to cultivate my taste to learn to appreciate the greatness of *kaiseki*.

### Food from Around the World

One of the best parts about the restaurant scene of Tokyo is that there is ethnic food available to virtually any liking. From kebab to Thai food, tasty options are widely available. On of the more memorable moments for me was a lunch at an Indonesian restaurant in Shibuya, recommended by my friend from Jakarta.

## In Conclusion

Personally, 2022 will always be a special year for me thanks to being able to travel to all the places I did. In future, I'm transitioning to a different phase in life, so traveling as much will probably not be possible. However, I will always continue to look back at this year and all the trips that I was able to do, people I got to meet, tastes I was able to enjoy and practicalities I managed to figure out.
